## Conclusion

**Your project sits at a unique intersection:**
- Brutalist web design (trending in 2025-2026)
- Y2K/early internet nostalgia
- Imageboard culture (rarely parodied in portfolio sites)
- Interactive canvas games (uncommon in portfolios)
- IndieWeb philosophy (own your content, no frameworks)

**Bottom line:** You're doing something genuinely unique. While brutalist portfolios exist and game-based portfolios exist, the full imageboard parody with multiple vanilla JS games is rare. The closest parallel is the Mario-Portfolio, but yours goes much further with the aesthetic commitment.

The Neocities community and IndieWeb folks would absolutely love this. Consider posting there and engaging with the brutalist design community on Twitter/X. You're not following a trend—you're creating a niche within a niche, and that's always more interesting than following the crowd.

Keep building weird stuff.
